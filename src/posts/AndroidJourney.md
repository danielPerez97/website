## Android Beginnings

When I first got into Android Development as a freshman in college, I had a simple goal in mind: I wanted to make an
app. "It'll be easy", I thought, since Mobile Apps tend to have a simpler UI, then what's happening under-the-hood had
to be simple as well. I couldn't have been more wrong.

### Making Apps Is *Hard*

I installed Android Studio, loaded up the Android Developer documentation and got to work. I even bought a book, so I
could structure my learning. I learned about Activities, Fragments, SQLiteOpenHelper, and while it was difficult, and
juggling all of them had its fair share of work involved, I was pleasantly surprised to find out Android Development was
*not* easy. It was actually *hard*.

This realization flew in the face of my assumption that developing Android apps would be easy.

### Unraveling the Wire

I kept going. It was hard at times, but I was still having fun. I never actually made any of the toy apps my book would
have me make; instead I would just apply the lessons to my own app idea, an app to keep track of assignments. There were
solutions at the time on the Play Store, but none of them were *mine*, something I knew I could tailor to my own needs.
